## 0.117.0 (Beta)

### October 2, 2023

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- The `datepicker` now includes a "close" button when rendered on touch-only devices (`@media (max-width: 431px) and (hover: none)`). This is accounted for in the genesis theme, but if you are using a custom theme, you should update it to account for this change.

### 💪 New features

- Adds [non-linear capability](/inputs/slider) to the slider input.
- Improves mobile styling of the datepicker input.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixes a bug that could cause duplicate options in the dropdown ([#975](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/975)).
- Fixes an issue that caused the `datepicker` to not display the correct date when set to `undefined` after having a valid date applied ([#972](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/975)).
