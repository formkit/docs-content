### Run the FormKit CLI

At your terminal, run `npx formkit create-app` to start your new project:

```sh
npx formkit create-app
```

`create-app` will ask you some questions about your project so it can determine what it needs to install and setup for you:

```sh
✔ Please enter a name for the project › <your-project-name>
✔ What framework would you like to use? › Vite / Nuxt
✔ What language should be used? › TypeScript / Javascript
✔ Would you like to install FormKit Pro? › no / yes
✔ Enter a project key from https://pro.formkit.com: › <fk-00000000000>
```

Once this is completed, you can follow the instructions to install all dependencies and start a development server:

```sh
Created formkit-app!

To run your new app:
📁 cd <your-project-name>
✅ npm install
🚀 npm run dev
```
