The `button` input uses HTML's [native button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button). The `label` prop is used to populate the text of the button â€” or alternatively you can use the default slot.

## Basic example

The easiest way to set the `label` of a button is with the `label` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Button input"
file: "_examples/button/button-base.vue"
---
::

## Default slot

The default slot can also be used to add text and UI to the button:

::Example
---
name: "Button input"
file: "_examples/button/button-default-slot.vue"
---
::

## Event listeners

You can also bind event listeners:

::Example
---
name: "Button input"
file: "_examples/button/button-events.vue"
---
::

## Ignored input

:IgnoredInputDocs


```html
<FormKit type="button" :ignore="false">
  Add a section
</FormKit>
```

## Props & Attributes

The `button` input is unique in that it does not actively receive input other than a transient click. However, nearly all of the base input props still technically exist on the input.
