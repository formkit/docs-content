The `range` input uses HTML's [native range input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) to let user select a number with a graphic slider.

## Cast to number

By default all native HTML `<input>` elements return a string value. The `number` prop allows you to cast the value to a true `number` type. There are two valid values for the `number` prop: `float` and `integer`.

These options use `parseFloat` (default) or `parseInt` respectively. If the value cannot be parsed by the respective function it will set the value to `undefined`. Additionally applying the `number` prop will constrain the `value` of the input to be exclusively `number | undefined` in TypeScript.

## Props & Attributes

The `range` input has only one unique prop, `number`, which can be used to cast the value of the input to a `number` type. Additionally, the native HTML `range` input has a few attributes that can be used to control the input.
