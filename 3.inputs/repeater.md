## Basic example

The `repeater` input is for repeating groups of inputs. You can use any number of FormKit inputs within a repeater, and repeaters themselves can be infinitely nested.

By default, the repeater input has the ability to shift, add, and remove items:

<!-- TODO: determine why drag and drop is not working on example -->

::Example
---
name: "Repeater"
file: "_examples/repeater/repeater-base.vue"
---
::


Unlike most other FormKit input types, the repeater input is of type [list](/inputs/list). You can see above that the `users` property (our repeater's value) is an array.

## Schema example

Like all other FormKit inputs, the Repeater is able to be used in a form written in FormKit [schema](/essentials/schema).

::Example
---
name: "Repeater"
file: "_examples/repeater/repeater-schema.vue"
---
::

## Add button attrs

In the previous example, the 'Add Users' button is provided by default, and the button label is derived from the repeater's `label`. We're able to customize the label by using the `add-button` prop and setting it to a `string`, or remove it completely by setting it to `false`. Alternatively, similar to the `submit-attrs` prop on the [FormKit's forms](/inputs/form), we can provide an object of attributes to be applied to the button with `add-attrs`. In this example, we change the label of the repeater from `Add Users` to `My custom label` using the `add-label` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Repeater"
file: "_examples/repeater/repeater-add-button-attrs.vue"
---
::


## Min/max

Like many other FormKit inputs, the repeater comes with a `min` and `max` prop. You can use these props to limit the number of items to be added or removed.

::Example
---
name: "Repeater"
file: "_examples/repeater/repeater-min-max.vue"
---
::

## Empty state

When a repeater is allowed to be empty by having its `min` prop set to `0` and having no values, you can control the content rendered in the empty state using the `empty` slot.

::Example
---
name: "Repeater"
file: "_examples/repeater/repeater-empty-state.vue"
---
::


## Controls

The repeater input by default comes with a set of controls that allow you to shift, add, and remove items. You can control the visibility of these controls by setting the `upControl`, `downControl`, `insertControl`, and `removeControl` props to `true` or `false`.

::Example
---
name: "Repeater"
file: "_examples/repeater/repeater-insert-control.vue"
---
::


## Custom controls

With FormKit's repeater, you are not restricted to our default controls. You can manipulate the repeater in anyway you want:

::Example
---
name: "Repeater"
file: [
  "_examples/repeater/repeater-controls.vue",
  "_examples/repeater/controls.ts"
]
---
::


## Setting errors

You can set errors on a repeater or any repeatable item using dot notation. Here we are using the
[`setErrors`](/inputs/form#using-nodeseterrors) helper, but there are other methods as well:

```js
// the 2nd argument of setErrors is input-level errors
formNode.setErrors( null, // no form errors,
  {
    // error on the repeater field:
    'teamMembers': ['There was a problem with 1 of your team members.']

    // error on a specific repeater item:
    'teamMembers.1.email': ['emily@formkit.com is already on a team.'],
  }
)
```

Remember, your submit handler is passed the form's core `node` and can be used
to conveniently set errors at depth. Read more about error handling
[here](/inputs/form#error-handling). Here's an example of a fake backend
returning errors for both the repeater and one child:

::Example
---
name: "Repeater"
file: "_examples/repeater/errors/repeater-errors.vue"
