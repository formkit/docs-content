## Introduction

The `mask` input automatically transforms user input to match a provided format. Used appropriately, mask inputs can provide an improved user experience by removing any ambiguity for the desired value (for example a phone number or social security number).

## Masks

The mask is the desired format of the input. It is passed to the `mask` prop where it is parsed for tokens. The mask is comprised of:

- **Tokens** - A string representation of a user-editable region. Shown in white below.
- **String literals** - Any character that is not a token. Not user-editable. Shown in orange below.

### Built-in tokens

The mask input comes with 4 built-in tokens:

- `h` - Accepts a hexadecimal character (`0-9a-fA-F`).
- `#` - Accepts a digit character.
- `a` - Accepts an alphabetical character.
- `*` - Accepts any character.

::Example
---
name: "Mask input"
file: "_examples/mask/simple.vue"
---
::

### Escaping built-ins

If you need to use one of the built-in tokens as a string literal in your mask, you can escape them with `\`. Here we are escaping the pound sign `#` to use in our hex color:

```html
<FormKit mask="\#hhhhhh" type="mask" />
```

## Modes

The mask input supports 3 entry modes:

- Shift (default)
- Replace
- Select

### Shift & replace mode

By default, the characters of a mask are automatically shifted forward when typing. This is notable when a mask is already populated and you place the cursor at or near the beginning of the input and begin typing. The characters following your cursor are "shifted" forward as you type. In replace mode, however, subsequent characters are overwritten with a new value:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input - shift vs replace"
file: "_examples/mask/shift-replace.vue"
---
::

### Select mode

In select mode, equivalent `char` type tokens are grouped into selectable text ranges. FormKit automatically selects these text ranges when clicking or focusing the input. These selection ranges are maintained as the user is typing. When used tastefully, this produces a clear UX as the user is aware of what value they are expected to enter.

Additionally, when an input is in select mode, the user can use the arrow or tab keys to shift their focus from one selection range to another:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input - select"
file: "_examples/mask/select.vue"
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Select mode options"
---
The <code>selectDirection</code> token property controls which direction new
characters flow into the selected range. You can fill "empty" selection characters with a predetermined value (like leading zeros "0") by using the <code>selectFill</code> property. See <a href="#creating-new-tokens">token properties</a>.
::

## Tokens

### Creating new tokens

What if a pattern can accept letters _or_ numbers in the same position? It’s relatively simple to create new tokens. There are 2 types of tokens:

- `char` accepts a single character.
- `enum` accepts any strings from an array of possible values.

The following properties must be defined to create a new token:

```js
{
  /**
   * The type of token. Can be a `char` or `enum`.
   */
  type: 'char',
  /**
   * The token to parse out of the mask.
   */
  token: 'z',
  /**
   * A placeholder character to display in the input when `show-mask` is
   * enabled.
   */
  placeholder: '_',
  /**
   * When using `select` mode, determines which direction do new characters flow
   * in.
   */
  selectDirection: 'left',
  /**
   * (Only for `char` type). A regular expression that describes the types of
   * characters that can appear in this slot. This pattern will be evaluated
   * against individual characters — not in the context of the entire string.
   */
  pattern: /[A-Za-z0-9]/,
  /**
   * (Only for `char` type, optional). An optional character to "fill" the
   * selection range with when in select mode. For example, a selectFill set to
   * "0" can be helpful with numbers to produce leading zeros like "001".
   */
  selectFill: "0",
  /**
   * (Only for `enum` type). An array of possible values.
   */
  values: [
    'March',
    'April',
    'May'
  ],
}
```

For example, a new token that accepts letters and numbers, and is represented by the letter `z` in the mask string would look like this:

```js
{
  type: 'char',
  token: 'z',
  pattern: /[A-Za-z0-9]/,
  placeholder: '_',
  selectDirection: 'left',
}
```

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Placeholders should not match pattern"
---
Any <code>placeholder</code> you define should not match the Regex <code>pattern</code> provided in the token definition.
::

#### Add tokens via prop

To pass a new token to the mask input, you can use the `tokens` prop which
expects an object with keys that match the `token` property. For example, our new token in the above example can be applied directly:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input"
file: "_examples/mask/tokens-prop.vue"
---
::

#### Add tokens globally

To register your mask tokens globally, extend the `config` property of your global FormKit configuration:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input global"
file: ['_examples/mask/tokens-global.vue', '_examples/mask/formkit.config.js']
init-file-tab: "formkit.config.js"
---
::

### Modify tokens

In addition to creating new tokens, the `tokens` prop can also modify existing tokens. Any value provided to the `tokens` prop will be merged into the existing tokens for that input. For example, the digit token’s (`#`) has no `selectFill` by default. To add one, extend it:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input - select fill"
file: "_examples/mask/select-fill.vue"
---
::

### Char tokens

`char` tokens accept a single character. In order for a character to be accepted, it must match the `token.pattern` regular expression. The four built in tokens (`h`, `#`, `a`, and `*`) are all `char` type tokens.

In `select` mode, `char` tokens are grouped together into a selection range.

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Placeholders"
---
A <code>char</code> token should only ever represent 1 character, and its placeholder should also only be a single character in length.
::

### Enum Tokens

Enum tokens allow for variable length masks within a predefined set of options. As a user begins to type, the enum token’s value will change to the first matching value, and the selection range will reflect the currently unmatched characters. In practice, this operates much like an autocomplete for that specific token. Additionally, users can cycle through available options for a given token by hitting the up/down arrow keys.

A date with auto-completing month names could be well represented with enums:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input – enum"
file: "_examples/mask/enum.vue"
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Select mode requirement"
---
Enums are only supported in <code>select</code> mode. When any <code>enum</code> token is found in a mask string, the <code>mode</code> of the input is forcibly set to <code>select</code>.
::

## Groups

Groups are a way to to treat multiple mask characters as a single unit. You create a group by surrounding the desired mask characters in `{}`:

```html
<FormKit mask="id{-a#a}" type="mask" />
<!-- "-a#a" is the group -->
```

On their own, groups don't do anything unless you define group options.

### Group options

Group options allow you to apply functionality to an entire group using a pipe `|` followed by the option name and any arguments. The available options are:

- **repeat** — allows a group to be repeated an infinite number of times.
- **placeholder** — A character to hold space prior to user input.

::Callout
---
type: "info"
label: "Group placeholders"
---
A placeholder defined within a group has a higher specificity than a placeholder defined in the token definition and will override it.
::

#### Option parameters

Arguments can be passed to a group option by using a colon, such as `placeholder:+`, where the plus symbol `+` is passed to the `placeholder` option.

You can string group options together:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input"
file: "_examples/mask/groups.vue"
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Can't be used in select mode"
---
  Groups cannot be used in select mode. An exception will be thrown.
::

## Prefix & suffix

You can ensure certain characters always appear at the beginning or end of an input by using the `prefix` and `suffix` props, respectively:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input"
file: "_examples/mask/prefix-suffix.vue"
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Values can't match the mask"
---
  Your prefix and suffix content can't match the mask. For instance, if your mask has a digit token <code>#</code>, your prefix/suffix can't contain numbers.
::

## Running the mask in reverse

In specific circumstances, you may want to run your mask in reverse. The mask will test if user input fulfills the mask from right to left. This is common in currency-type inputs and can be applied by adding the `reverse` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input"
file: "_examples/mask/reverse.vue"
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Shift mode requirement"
---
Running a mask in reverse only works in shift mode.
::

## Mask values

### Incomplete values

A mask’s value is not considered "complete" until the user has filled the entire pattern. Until that point, FormKit will consider the value of the input "empty". This makes it convenient to use with validation rules like `required`. However, if you’d like to accept incomplete values, you can via the `allow-incomplete` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input - allow incomplete"
file: "_examples/mask/allow-incomplete.vue"
---
::

### Unmasked values

By default, the value of a mask input includes the formatting provided via the `mask` prop. However, if you'd like the raw unmasked value with the string literals removed, you can use the `unmask-value` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input - unmask value"
file: "_examples/mask/unmask-value.vue"
---
::

## Hiding the mask

By default, the `mask` input displays each token’s placeholder character. You can disable this behavior (except in select mode) while still applying formatting automatically via the `show-mask` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Mask input - show mask"
file: "_examples/mask/show-mask.vue"
---
::

## Overlay (colorizing a mask)

By default, a mask’s value is displayed via the value of its input element. Although this works "out of the box" it does now allow for the text be stylistically differentiated. For example it would be nice if the "literal" portions of the mask looked different than the "placeholder" portions.

To achieve this effect, you can enable an `overlay` which renders DOM elements that are positioned directly over the input itself. The text inside the input is still there, but it will be transparent. In general the necessary overlay positioning styles are automatically applied for you.

The overlay contains 4 possible sections you can target your styles at:

- Literal (`.formkit-overlay-literal` or `overlay-literal-class`)
- Placeholder (`.formkit-overlay-placeholder` or `overlay-placeholder-class`)
- Enum (`.formkit-overlay-enum` or `overlay-enum-class`)
- Char (`.formkit-overlay-char` or `overlay-char-class`)

The default genesis theme automatically supports the overlay and applies light gray colors to the placeholder. If you are not using Genesis, please ensure the `inner` section is positioned (like `position: relative`).

name: "Mask input - overlay"
file: "_examples/mask/overlay.vue"
