:InputPageHero

The `file` input uses HTML's [native file input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file). It allows users to select files from their device for upload. In addition to native input features, it adds support for:

- Drag and drop
- Clearing the input
- Repopulating from an array

## Basic example

::Example
---
name: "File input"
file: "_examples/file/file.vue"
---
::

## Array value

The value of the `file` type should always be an array of objects where each object contains a `name` (string) and optional `file` ([File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)) property. When selecting new files from a user‚Äôs device, FormKit will convert [the native `FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList) to the required array-based structure automatically.

This structure can be used to pre-populate a file input with previously uploaded file values:

::Example
---
name: "File input"
file: "_examples/file-populate/file-populate.vue"
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Display only"
---
Pre-populating an input with file names is for display purposes only. It‚Äôs an optional feature that provides a consistent interface to convey that a file was <em>previously</em> uploaded ‚Äî however ‚Äî a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList">FileList</a> is not attached to the actual <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag for upload.
::

### Uploading files

The file upload process is left to your form‚Äôs submission handler. When submitting the form [via full page request](/inputs/form#submitting-as-a-page-request) no further processing is necessary, however when submitting [via XHR/Fetch request](/inputs/form#submitting-via-xhrfetch-request) you will need to create an [instance of `FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) with the files attached. Here is a working example:

::Example
---
  name: "File input"
  file: "_examples/file-upload/file-upload.vue"
---
::

## Props & Attributes

The `file` input has a few unique props. There are also several commonly used native HTML attributes that assist in controlling file uploads.

attrs: ['accept', 'capture', 'multiple', 'webkitdirectory']
data: [

    "default": "‚Äô‚Äô",
    "description": "Specifies <a href='/essentials/icons'>an icon</a> to put in the <code>fileItemIcon</code> section. Only shows when there is a file selected. Defaults to the <code>fileDoc</code> icon."

  },
  {
    "prop": "no-files-icon",
    "type": "String",
    "default": "‚Äô‚Äô",
    "description": "Specifies <a href='/essentials/icons'>an icon</a> to put in the <code>noFilesIcon</code> section. Only shows when no file is selected. Defaults to the <code>fileDoc</code> icon."
