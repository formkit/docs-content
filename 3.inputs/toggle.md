## Basic example

The `toggle` input — sometimes called a "switch" — offers a choice between one of two values; it's a great option when you want the user to toggle a feature on or off:

::Example
---
name: "Toggle"
file: "_examples/toggle/toggle-base.vue"
---
::

## Values

The values for the toggle are `undefined` if not-interacted with, `true` if checked, and `false` if unchecked. You can change these values by passing the `onValue` and `offValue` props. In this example, we will set the `onValue` to the string `'active'` and the `offValue` to the string `'inactive'`:

::Example
---
name: "Toggle"
file: "_examples/toggle/toggle-values.vue"
---
::

## Labels

### Primary label

By default, the toggle input supports a primary label like the `label` prop on any other FormKit input. The primary label is displayed to the right of the toggle unless you use a `Value label`, which will then move it above the toggle:

::Example
---
name: "Toggle"
file: "_examples/toggle/toggle-primary-label.vue"
---
::

### Alt label position

If you would like the label to be displayed above the toggle, you can use the `alt-label-position` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Toggle"
file: "_examples/toggle/toggle-alt-label-position.vue"
---
::

### Value label

Additionally, you may specify secondary labels by setting the `on-value-label` and the `off-value-label` props. These values are conditionally shown based on the on/off state of the toggle. The value labels render to the right of the toggle input. The "primary label" will be moved to the alternative label position above the toggle when value labels are used:

::Example
---
name: "Toggle"
file: "_examples/toggle/toggle-value-labels.vue"
---
::


### Inner value labels

Additionally, you can set the `value-label-display` prop to `inner` to render the value labels inside the toggle. The `Primary label` will return to being displayed to the right of the toggle:

::Example
---
name: "Toggle"
file: "_examples/toggle/toggle-labels-inner.vue"
---
::


## Icons

The `thumb-icon` prop allows you to insert an icon into the `thumb` section of the `toggle` input. This prop accepts a string that's passed to FormKit's [icon plugin](/essentials/icons):

::Example
---
name: "Toggle"
file: "_examples/toggle/toggle-icon.vue"
---
::


## Colors

The toggle input supports color props for its various sections for easy styling. Each prop contains on and off states that are applied depending on whether the toggle is on or off. The following example uses some of these color props. See the [Props & Attributes](#props--attributes) section below for a full list of these props:

::Example
---
name: "Toggle"
file: "_examples/toggle/toggle-icon-colors.vue"
---
::

The `toggle` input is built atop HTML's [native checkbox input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox).
