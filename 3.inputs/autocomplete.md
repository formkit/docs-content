:ProInstallSnippet

The `autocomplete` input allows you to search through a list of options.

The `options` prop can accept three different formats of values:

- An array of objects with `value` and `label` keys (see example above)
- An array of strings `['A', 'B', 'C']`
- An object literal with key-value pairs `{ a: 'A', b: 'B', c: 'C' }`
- A function that returns any of the above

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Empty options"
---
If you assign options as an empty array, the input will be rendered in a disabled state.
::

## Basic examples

### Single-select

By default, the autocomplete input will render in single-select mode:


::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-single.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

### Multi-select

By setting the `multiple` prop the autocomplete input will render in multi-select mode:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-multiple.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "info"
label: "Multi-select input value"
---
Notice in the example above that because the `multiple` prop is set, the `value` prop must be an array.

::

## Filtering

The autocomplete input will filter options with its own internal search function. You can replace this search function by providing the `filter` prop a function of your own. Your function will receive two arguments, the `option` being iterated over and the current `search` value:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-filter.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

## Dynamic options

Instead of passing a static list to the `options` prop, you can assign it to a function. Doing so is useful when you need to load options from an API or another source.

### Search parameter

In this example, we'll assign the `options` prop the `searchMovies` function. By doing so, searchMovies will receive the `context` object as an argument. Within this context object is the `search` property, which is the current search value. To perform our search, we'll use the search value as the query parameter for our API request:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-single-request.vue"
---
::

### Page and hasNextPage parameters

A likely scenario you'll encounter is needing to search through a paginated API. This can be done by referencing the same `context` object as before. Within this object, we can utilize the `page` and `hasNextPage` properties. The page property is the current page number, and the hasNextPage property is a function to be called when there are more pages to load:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-pagination.vue"
---
::

### Option loader

#### Rehydrating values

FormKit's autocomplete input also provides an `optionLoader` prop that allows you to rehydrate values that are not in the options list. In this example, we'll provide the autocomplete an initial value (a movie ID), and assign the optionLoader to a function that will make a request to the API to get the movie:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-pagination-option-loader.vue"
---
::

Notice in the example above that the optionLoader function is passed two arguments: the `value` of the selected option (in this case, the movie ID) and the `cachedOption`. The cachedOption prop is used for preventing unnecessary lookups. If the cachedOption is not `null` it means that the selected option has already been loaded, and you can return the cachedOption directly.

### Loading Style

Instead of requiring your users to click the <i>Load more</i> button to load additional options, you can set the `loadOnScroll` prop to true, which will paginate options as you scroll to the bottom of the options list.

### Load on created

If you would rather load options when the autocomplete is created, you can set the `load-on-created` prop to true, and our function, `loadCurrentlyPopularMovies` will be called without the user needing to expand the listbox:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-load-on-created.vue"
---
::

## Option appearance

### Option slot

The autocomplete input allows you to customize the look and feel of each option by using the option slot. In this example, we are using the option slot to display each option's asset, logo, and name:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-option-slot.vue",
  "_examples/_data/car-brands.js"
]
---
::

## Selection appearance

The autocomplete input allows you to customize the look and feel of the selected option.

### Selection appearance prop

The autocomplete input allows you to customize the look and feel of the selected option by using the `selection-appearance` prop. For either the single-select or multi-select
autocomplete, you can set the selection-appearance prop to `text-input` (default) or `option`:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-selection-appearance.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

### Selection slot

If you only want to customize the display of the selected option, set the selection appearance to `option`.

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-slot-selection.vue",
  "_examples/_data/car-brands.js"
]
---

::


## Behavioral props

### Empty message

The autocomplete input, by default, will not expand the listbox when no search results are found while filtering. You can change this behavior by assigning the `empty-message` prop a message to display when no results are found:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-empty-message.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

### Close on select

If you would like the listbox to remain expanded after selecting a value, you can set `close-on-select` to `false`.

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-close-on-select.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

### Reload on commit

If you want the options to be reloaded when the user commits a selection, use the `reload-on-commit` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-reload-on-commit.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::


### Open on click

To enable opening the autocomplete's listbox on click of its search input, set the `open-on-click` prop to `true`:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-open-on-click.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

### Open on focus

If you would like to open the autocomplete's listbox anytime the input is clicked, set the `open-on-focus` prop to `true`:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-open-on-focus.vue"
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Open on focus vs Open on click"
---
If `open-on-focus` is used, `open-on-click` will implicitly be set.
::

### Clear search on open

For single-select autocompletes only, if you would like to clear the search input when the listbox is opened, set the `clear-search-on-open`:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-clear-search-on-open.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

### Selection removable

For a single-select autocomplete, you can set the `selection-removable` prop. When set to `true`, a remove button will be displayed next to the selected option. This prop is by default set to `true` for autocompletes with selection appearance of `option`.

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Single select only"
---
The <code>selection-removable</code> prop cannot be used for multi-selects.
::


::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-selection-removable.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

### Open on remove

If you want the listbox to expand when an selection is removed, use the `open-on-remove` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-open-on-remove.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::

### Max

If you would like to limit the number of options that can be selected, you can use the `max` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-max.vue",
  "_examples/_data/countries.js"
]
---
::


## Full example

Now let's combine what we've learned so far by leveraging the `option` slot for custom markup, and setting the `options` prop to a function that will return pages of movies from an API:

::Example
---
name: "Autocomplete"
min-height: 550
file: [
  "_examples/autocomplete-pro/autocomplete-full.vue",
  "_examples/_data/top-movies.js"
]
---

## Sections & slot data

:SectionKeysIntro

The autocomplete's structure changes depending on a few different scenarios:

- Whether `selection-appearance` has been set to `text-input` (the default) or `option`.
- Whether multiple selections are enabled via the `multiple` attribute.
