The select input uses HTML's [native select input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select). Select inputs can be single value selections, or multi-value selections by using the `multiple` attribute. There are 4 ways to provide options to a select input:

- An array of strings
- An object of value/label pairs
- An array of objects with `label` and `value` properties (the same as the [checkbox](/inputs/checkbox) and [radio](/inputs/radio) inputs)
- Using `<option>` tags directly inside the `default` slot.

## Single selection

Select lists are most commonly used to select a single item from a list of options.

### Array of strings

The simplest way to provide options is an array of strings. The provided strings will be used for both the label and the value of the option.

::Example
---
name: "Select input - strings"
file: "_examples/select-strings/select-strings.vue"
---
::


### Value / Label object

You may also provide the `options` prop where the keys are values and the values of each property are labels.

::Example
---
name: "Select input"
file: "_examples/select/select.vue"
---
::


### Array of objects

The most flexible way to define options is by providing an array of objects. The objects _must_ include `value` and `label` properties¬†‚Äî¬†but may also include a `help` property as well as an `attrs` object of additional attributes to apply to each select input tag.

::Example
---
name: "Select input - objects"
file: "_examples/select-objects/select-objects.vue"
---
::


::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Option attributes"
---
To pass additional attributes to each <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> element, your object can also contain an <code>attrs</code> property.<br><br>
```js
[
  {
    label: 'My Label',
    value: 'a-value',
    attrs: {
      disabled: true
    }
  }
]
```
::

### Option groups (`optgroup`)

Using the [array of objects](#array-of-objects) syntax you can also create option groups (`<optgroup>` in HTML). To do so provide a `group` option:

::Example
---
name: "Option groups"
file: "_examples/select-groups/select-groups.vue"
---
::
### Default slot

Sometimes it may be desirable to manually output the contents of a select list in order to create specialized structures. This can be done by using the `default` slot to explicitly output your options.

::Example
---
name: "Select input - objects"
file: "_examples/select-slot/select-slot.vue"
---
::


::Callout
---
type: "warning"
---
When using the default slot to output options, you should not use the <code>placeholder</code> or <code>options</code> props.
::

## Multiple

The `select` input also supports a `multiple` attribute that allows for multi-selection. When used with FormKit, this option produces an array of values.

::Example
---
name: "Select input - objects"
file: "_examples/select-multiple/select-multiple.vue"
---
::


::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Alternatives"
---
Select inputs with the <code>multiple</code> attribute can be challenging for some users because they require holding-down the control or command keys to perform multiple selections. Depending on your audience, you may want to consider using a <a href="/inputs/checkbox">checkbox input with <code>options</code></a> instead.
::

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Multiple with default slot"
---
When using the default slot in conjunction with the <code>multiple</code> attribute you must explicitly assign the <code>selected</code> attribute to each option.
