## Basic example

The `rating` input allows users to provide feedback based on a numeric scale represented by icons/images:

::Example
---
name: "Rating"
file: "_examples/rating/rating-base.vue"
---
::


## Min/max

The `min` and `max` props define the minimum and maximum values an end-user can select. The `max` determines the number of icons rendered:

::Example
---
name: "Rating"
file: "_examples/rating/rating-min-max.vue"
---
::


## Step

By default, the `rating` input will increment by 1. The `step` prop will allow you to set the step size between each value. For example, if you set `step="0.5"`, the end-user can select any value that is a multiple of `0.5`. Steps must be a value between `0.01` and `1`:

::Example
---
name: "Rating"
file: "_examples/rating/rating-step.vue"
---
::


## Icons

By default, the `rating` input uses FormKit's own star icon. You can change which icon is being used by setting the `rating-icon` prop. This prop accepts a string that will use FormKit's [icon plugin](/essentials/icons):

::Example
---
name: "Rating"
file: "_examples/rating/rating-icon.vue"
---
::


### Slots for icons

#### Default slot

Instead of specifying an icon via the FormKit icon plugin, you can pass a raw SVG using the `default` slot:

::Example
---
name: "Rating"
file: "_examples/rating/rating-default-slot.vue"
---
::


#### Named slots

Lastly, you can use the `offItem` and `onItem` slots to pass whatever assets you want.In this example, we'll use different images for the `off` and `on` states:

::Example
---
name: "Rating"
file: "_examples/rating/rating-named-slots.vue"
---
::


## Colors

In addition to supplying an icon, you can also specify the color via props. Setting the `off-color` prop will change the color of the icons when they are not selected. The `on-color` prop will change the color of the icons when they are selected:

::Example
---
name: "Rating"
file: "_examples/rating/rating-colors.vue"
---
::
