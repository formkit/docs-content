The `password` input uses HTML's [native password input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password). It allows a user to privately enter their password. When creating new passwords, this input is often compiled with the `confirm` validation rule.

## Example

::Example

name: "Password input"
file: "_examples/password/password.vue"

### Toggle password visibility

By leveraging the [icons](/essentials/icons) support built in to FormKit you can easily create a password input where password visibility can be toggled.
