The `search` input uses HTML's [native search input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search). Generally, search inputs are the same as text inputs, but may have different styling or features based on the browser. For example, browsers often add a small "X" to clear the input when it has a value.
