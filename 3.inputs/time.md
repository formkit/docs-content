The `time` input uses HTML's [native time input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time). It allows a user to enter a single line of time.

## Basic example

file: "_examples/time/time.vue"

type: "warning"

The internal format of all native time pickers is <code>HH:MM</code>. This is true even though the format of the time displayed to the user may be 12 hour or 24 hour.
