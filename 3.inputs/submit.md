The `submit` input uses HTML's [native button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button). The `label` prop is used to populate the text of the button ‚Äî¬†or alternatively you can use the default slot.

type: "info"
label: "Button Element"

Type <code>submit</code> input uses a <code>button</code> element instead of an <code>input=type"submit"</code> because an <code>input</code> is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element" title="Void element">void element</a>. As a container element, a <code>button</code> can include content and pseudo elements ‚Äî making them the more flexible option for developers.

## Basic Example

The easiest way to set the `label` of a `submit` button is with the `label` prop:

::Example
---
name: "Submit input"
file: "_examples/submit/submit-base.vue"
---
::


## Default slot

The default slot can also be used to add text and UI to the button:

::Example
---
name: "Submit input"
file: "_examples/submit/submit-default-slot.vue"
---
::


## Event listeners

You can also bind event listeners:

::Example
---
name: "Submit input"
file: "_examples/submit/submit-events.vue"
---
::


## Provided submit button

Note that FormKit forms automatically [output a submit button](/inputs/form#provided-submit-button). You can opt out of the built-in submit button and use your own, but will need to re-implement features such as the loading spinner (provided by the Genesis theme) or automatic disabling of the button while the form is submitting.

### Disable your submit while the form is disabled

If you use your own submit button, you can dynamically disable it according to the form's disabled status (`context.disabled`), which you can pull from the `#default` slot prop:

```html
<FormKit
  type="form"
  :actions="false"
  #default="{ disabled }"
  @submit="yourSubmitHandler"
>
  <FormKit type="submit" :disabled="disabled" />
</FormKit>
```

You can also disable your own submit button [via schema](https://formkit.link/6e6d3e9b251a3662af15bd0c1c55e4be).

## Ignored input

<ignored-input-docs></ignored-input-docs>

```html
<FormKit type="button" :ignore="false"> Add a section </FormKit>
```

## Props & Attributes

The `submit` input (along with [`button`](/inputs/button)) is unique in that it does not actively receive input other than a transient click. However, nearly all of the base input props still technically exist on the input.
