The `url` input uses HTML's [native url input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url). It allows a user to enter a single URL.

## Basic example

::Example
---
name: "URL input"
file: "_examples/url/url.vue"
---
::


::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Consider using text input"
---
Although FormKit supports the <code>url</code> input type, the primary reason this input is provided in the HTML spec is validation. Since FormKit has its own validation system the utility provided by this input is not significant and can complicate your form submissions. In most cases you are better off using a <code>text</code> input with the <code>url</code> validation rule.
