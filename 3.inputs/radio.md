:InputPageHero

The `radio` input uses HTML's [native radio inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) to allow a user to select one value from a series of options. The `options` prop is required for radio inputs and can be provided in 3 ways:

- An array of strings
- An object of value/label pairs
- An array of objects with `label` and `value` properties (the same as the [checkbox](/inputs/checkbox) and [select](/inputs/select) inputs)

### Array of strings

The simplest way to provide options is an array of strings. The provided strings will be used for both the label and the value of the option.

::Example
---
name: "Radio input"
file: "_examples/radio-strings/radio-strings.vue"
---
::


### Value / Label object

You may also provide the `options` prop where the keys are values and the values of each property are labels.

::Example
---
name: "Radio input"
file: "_examples/radio-object/radio-object.vue"
---
::


### Array of objects

The most flexible way to define options is by providing an array of objects. The objects _must_ include `value` and `label` propertiesÂ â€”Â but may also include a `help` property as well as an `attrs` object of additional attributes to apply to each radio input tag.

::Example
---
name: "Radio input"
file: "_examples/radio-objects/radio-objects.vue"
