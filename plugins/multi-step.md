# Multi-Step Input Plugin

:PageToc

## Introduction

FormKit ships with a first-party multi-step input plugin available from the `@formkit/addons` package. This input allows you to build a wizard or easily break your forms into multiple steps. Breaking forms into multiple steps can improve the user-experience of larger forms by keeping them feeling small and approachable compared to listing all inputs at once.

## Installation

To use this plugin with FormKit, install `@formkit/addons`:

```bash
yarn add @formkit/addons
```

Once you've installed the addons package, you'll need to register the plugin with FormKit and include the supporting CSS styles:

```js
// formkit.config.js
import { defaultConfig } from '@formkit/vue'
import { createMultiStepPlugin } from '@formkit/addons'
import '@formkit/addons/css/multistep'

const config = defaultConfig({
  plugins: [createMultiStepPlugin()],
})

export default config
```

#### A quick demonstration of the `multi-step` input type in action:

::Example
---
name: "Multi-Step Introduction"
file: [
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/intro/intro.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/stepOne.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/stepTwo.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/stepThree.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/formkit.config.js'
]
---
::

## Usage

The `createMultiStepPlugin` function registers two new input types for you to use with the `FormKit` component.

- `multi-step`: The wrapping group for the entire multi-step input. This input keeps track of which step is active, validation and errors per step, and should only contain `step` inputs as its immediate children
- `step`: The wrapping group for a given step within your multi-step input. Should only be an immediate child of a `multi-step` input. Its children will be rendered as the contents of the step.

Using these inputs together is as simple as wrapping any markup you want to have present within a step in a multi-step form.

```html
<FormKit type="multi-step">
  <FormKit type="step" name="stepOne">
    <!-- content for stepOne goes here! -->
  </FormKit>
</FormKit>
```

Out-of-the-box the parent `multi-step` input will track the validity of the inputs contained in each child `step` input and prevent advancing to the next `step` until the current step is valid. The count of total blocking validations and errors will be shown next to the current step name if a user attempts to advance to the next step or submit the form before satisfying the current step's input validations.

## Tab style

The `multi-step` input ships with two available tab styles.

- `tab`: The default tab experience. Each step name is show in a tab with an active state. Error count is shown in the top right of the tab.
- `progress`: A progress bar style where each step is a "node" on a timeline of total steps. With this display mode you can also use the `hide-progress-labels` prop to hide the step names.

::Example
---
name: "Multi-Step Introduction"
file: [
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/tab-style/tab-style.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/tab-style/multi-step-content.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/formkit.config.js'
]
---
::

## Step labels

By default the `multi-step` input will use the `name` attribute of its child `step` inputs to generate labels for steps. If you'd like more control over the display of your step names you can use the `label` prop. You can also customize the labels that appear in the `stepActions` section of your `step` using the `previous-label` and `next-label` props.

- `label`: An override for the step name that should appear in the multi-step tabs.
- `previous-label`: an override for the `stepPrevious` button label which defaults to `Back`.
- `next-label`: an override for the `stepNext` button label which defaults to `Next`.

::Example
---
name: "Step Labels"
file: [
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/step-labels/step-labels.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/formkit.config.js'
]
---
::

## Allow incomplete steps

By default the `multi-step` input will allow advancing to later steps even if the current step or a step between the current step and the target step has blocking validation messages. To prevent a user from jumping ahead set the `allow-incomplete` prop to `false`.

::Example
---
name: "Allow Incomplete"
file: [
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/allow-incomplete/allow-incomplete.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/stepOne.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/stepTwo.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/stepThree.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/formkit.config.js'
]
---
::

## Valid step icon

When a step has been completed with no validation errors the `multi-step` input will — by default — render a check icon showing that the step is valid and no more action is required. The `valid-step-icon` is a [FormKit Icon](/essentials/icons) and can be changed via a prop like any other FormKit icon.

You can either:

- Change the `valid-step-icon` on the `multi-step` input to change the icon for all steps inside the input.
- Change the `valid-step-icon` on a `step` input to change or override the icon just for that step.

::Example
---
name: "Valid Step Icon"
file: [
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/valid-step-icon/valid-step-icon.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/formkit.config.js'
]
---
::

## Customizing step actions

Each `step` in a `multi-step` input has default buttons rendered for moving between steps. By default the first `step` in a `multi-step` will only have a `stepNext` action button rendered, and the last `step` will only have a `stepPrevious` action button. This allows a multi-step to act as a self-contained group within the context of a larger form.

If you want to add a custom action such as a form submit to a `multi-step` — useful if you're using the `multi-step` as your whole form — you can do so by overriding the `stepNext` slot on the desired step. In this case we'll add a `submit` input to the last step in our `multi-step` input to submit the form.

The `stepNext` and `stepPrevious` sections have access to the `incrementStep` handler — which returns a callable function — to enable programatic navigation.

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
label: "Tab navigation"
---
By default, the <code>stepNext</code> in a multi-step input uses event listeners to capture tab navigation via keyboard and allow users to cycle through all available steps within a multi-step.<br><br>If you want to preserve this behaviour in your own custom <code>stepNext</code> implementation then be sure to add a <code>data-next="true"</code> attribute to your focusable element that triggers step navigation.

## The beforeStepChange event

Sometimes you need to _do_ something with your form data between steps. Maybe you want to submit each step independently to your back-end or you need to log analytics events to determine how far users are making it through your form. In cases such as these you can use the `beforeStepChange` event. `beforeStepChange` accepts a function and is provided a context object with the following keys:

- `currentStep`: The currently active step node context object that the user is navigating away from.
- `targetStep`: The step node context object that the user is navigating to.
- `delta`: The distance between steps. Positive integers represent stepping forward, negative integers represent stepping backward.

Your `beforeStepChange` function should return a `Boolean`. Returning `false` will _prevent_ the step change from ocurring.

`beforeStepChange` can be used on your `multi-step` input in which case it will apply to _all_ steps. Additionally you can use `beforeStepChange` on a specific `step` input to run your function only when navigating away from the step which has the function assigned. `beforeStepChange` applied to a `step` will override any `beforeStepChange` set on a parent `multi-step` if one exists.

::Example
---
name: "beforeStepChange"
file: [
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/before-step-change/before-step-change.vue',
'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/formkit.config.js'
]

## Programatic Nagivation

The multi-step node is equipped with convenient helper functions designed to facilitate programmatic navigation between any of its steps. These functions include:

- `next`: It goes to the next `step` from the current selected step.
- `previous`: It goes to the previous `step` from the current selected step.
- `goTo`: It accepts a `step` argument to move to that step from the current selected step, it accepts the index or the name of the step.

'/\_content/_examples/multi-step/programatic-navigation/programatic-navigation.vue',
