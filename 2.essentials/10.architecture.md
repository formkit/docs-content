# Architecture

## Introduction

At the heart of the FormKit framework is `@formkit/core`. This zero-dependency package is responsible for nearly all of FormKit's low-level critical functions, such as:

- Configuration
- Value input/output
- Event bubbling
- Plugin management
- Tree state tracking
- Message management
- Lifecycle hooks

## Architecture

The functionality of FormKit core is not exposed to your application via a centralized instance but rather a distributed set of "nodes" (`FormKitNode`) where each node represents a single input.

This mirrors HTML — in fact DOM structure is actually a [general tree](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/Everything/html/GenTreeIntro.html) and FormKit core nodes reflect this structure. For example, a simple login form could be drawn as the following tree graph:

<figure>

  :TreeSimple

  <figcaption>Hover over each node to see its initial options.</figcaption>
</figure>

In this diagram, a `form` node is a parent to three child nodes — `email`, `password` and `submit`. Each input component in the graph "owns" a FormKit core node, and each node contains its own options, configuration, props, events, plugins, lifecycle hooks, etc. This architecture ensures that FormKit’s primary features are decoupled from the rendering framework (Vue) — a key to reducing side effects and maintaining blazing fast performance.

Additionally, this decentralized architecture allows for tremendous flexibility. For example — one form could use different plugins than other forms in the same app, a group input could modify the configuration of its sub-inputs, and validation rules can even be written to use props from another input.

## Node

Every `<FormKit>` component owns a single core node, and each node must be one of three types:

- [Input](#input)
- [List](#list)
- [Group](#group)

::Callout

label: "Input vs node types"

Core nodes are always one of three types (input, list, or group). These are not the same as input types — of which there can be unlimited variation. Strictly speaking all inputs have 2 types: their node type (like <code>input</code>), and their input type (like <code>checkbox</code>).
::

### Input

Most of FormKit’s native inputs have a node type of `input` — they operate on a single value. The value itself can be of any type, such as objects, arrays, strings, and numbers — any value is acceptable. However, nodes of type `input` are always leafs — meaning they cannot have children.

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const input = createNode({
  type: 'input', // defaults to 'input' if not specified
  value: 'hello node world',
})

console.log(input.value)
// 'hello node world'
```

### List

A list is a node that produces an array value. Children of a list node produce a value in the list’s array value. The names of immediate children are ignored — instead each is assigned an index in the list’s array.

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const list = createNode({
  type: 'list',
  children: [
    createNode({ value: 'paprika@example.com' }),
    createNode({ value: 'bill@example.com' }),
    createNode({ value: 'jenny@example.com' }),
  ],
})

console.log(list.value)
// ['paprika@example.com', 'bill@example.com', 'jenny@example.com']
```

### Group

A group is a node that produces an object value. Children of a group node use their `name` to produce a property of the same name in the group’s value object — `<FormKit type="form">` is an instance of a group.

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const group = createNode({
  type: 'group',
  children: [
    createNode({ name: 'meat', value: 'turkey' }),
    createNode({ name: 'greens', value: 'salad' }),
    createNode({ name: 'sweets', value: 'pie' }),
  ],
})

console.log(group.value)
// { meat: 'turkey', greens: 'salad', sweets: 'pie' }
```

### Options

In addition to specifying the `type` of node when calling `createNode()`, you can pass any of the following options:

<div class="reference-table">

| Options  | Default      | Description                                                                    |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| children | `[]`         | Child `FormKitNode` instances.                                                 |
| config   | `{}`         | Configuration options. These become the defaults of the `props` object.        |
| name     | `{type}_{n}` | The name of the node/input.                                                    |
| parent   | `null`       | The parent `FormKitNode` instance.                                             |
| plugins  | `[]`         | An array of plugin functions.                                                  |
| props    | `{}`         | An object of key/value pairs that represent the current node instance details. |
| type     | `input`      | The type of `FormKitNode` to create (`list`, `group`, or `input`).             |
| value    | `undefined`  | The initial value of the input.                                                |

</div>

### Config & Props

FormKit uses an inheritance-based configuration system. Any values declared in the `config` option are automatically passed to children (and all descendants) of that node, but not passed to siblings or parents. Each node can override its inherited values by providing its own config, and these values will in turn be inherited by any deeper children and descendants. For example:

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const parent = createNode({
  type: 'group',
  config: {
    color: 'yellow',
  },
  children: [
    createNode({
      type: 'list',
      config: { color: 'pink' },
      children: [createNode(), createNode()],
    }),
    createNode(),
  ],
})
```

The above code will result in each node having the following configuration:

<figure>

  :TreeConfig

  <figcaption>Notice how the list subtree is pink.</figcaption>

</figure>

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Use props to read config"
---
It is best practice to read configuration values from <code>node.props</code> rather than <code>node.config</code>. The next section details this feature.
::

### Props

The `node.props` and `node.config` objects are closely related. `node.config` is best thought of as the initial values for `node.props`. `props` is an arbitrarily shaped object that contains details about the current _instance_ of the node.

The best practice is to always read configuration and prop data from `node.props` even if the original value is defined using `node.config`. Explicitly defined props take precedence over configuration options.

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const child = createNode({
  props: {
    flavor: 'cherry',
  },
})
const parent = createNode({
  type: 'group',
  config: {
    size: 'large',
    flavor: 'grape',
  },
  children: [child],
})
console.log(child.props.size)
// outputs: 'large'
console.log(child.props.flavor)
// outputs: 'cherry'
```

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "FormKit component props"
---
When using the <code>&lt;FormKit&gt;</code> component, any props defined for the input <code>type</code> are automatically set as <code>node.props</code> properties. For example: <code>&lt;FormKit label="Email" /&gt;</code> would result in <code>node.props.label</code> being <code>Email</code>.
::

### Setting values

You can set the initial value of a node by providing the `value` option on `createNode()` — but FormKit is all about interactivity, so how do we update the value of an already defined node? By using `node.input(value)`.

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const username = createNode()
username.input('jordan-goat98')
console.log(username.value)
// undefined  👀 wait — what!?
```

In the above example `username.value` is still undefined immediately after it’s set because `node.input()` is asynchronous. If you need to read the resulting value after calling `node.input()` you can await the returned promise.

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const username = createNode()
username.input('jordan-goat98').then(() => {
  console.log(username.value)
  // 'jordan-goat98'
})
```

Because `node.input()` is asynchronous, the rest of our form does not need to recompute its dependencies on every keystroke. It also provides an opportunity to perform modifications to the unsettled value before it is "committed" to the rest of the form. However — for internal node use only — a `_value` property containing the unsettled value of the input is also available.

::Callout
---
type: "danger"
label: "Don’t assign values"
---
You cannot <em>directly</em> assign the value of an input <code>node.value = 'foo'</code>. Instead, you should always use <code>node.input(value)</code>
::

### Value settlement

Now that we understand `node.input()` is asynchronous, let's explore how FormKit solves the "settled tree" problem. Imagine a user quickly types in their email address and hits "enter" very quickly — thus submitting the form. Since `node.input()` is asynchronous, incomplete data would likely be submitted. We need a mechanism to know when the whole form has "settled".

To solve this, FormKit’s nodes automatically track tree, subtree, and node "disturbance". This means the form (usually the root node) always knows the settlement state of all the inputs it contains.

The following graph illustrates this "disturbance counting". Click on any input node (blue) to simulate calling `node.input()` and notice how the whole form is always aware of how many nodes are "disturbed" at any given time. When the root node has a disturbed count of `0` the form is settled and safe to submit.

<figure>

  :TreeDisturbance

  <figcaption>Click on the inputs (blue) to simulate calling a user input.</figcaption>
</figure>
To ensure a given tree (form), subtree (group), or node (input) is "settled" you can await the `node.settled` property:

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const form = createNode({
  type: 'group',
  children: [
    createNode(),
    createNode(),
    createNode()
  ],
})
// ...
// user interaction:
async function someEvent () {
  await form.settled
  // we now know the form is fully "settled"
  // and that form.value is accurate.
}
```

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "The form type"
---
The <code>&lt;FormKit type="form"&gt;</code> input already incorporates this await behavior. It will not call your <code>@submit</code> handler until your form is completely settled. However when building advanced inputs it can be useful to understand these underlying principles.
::

### Getting a component’s node

Sometimes it can be helpful to get the underlying instance of a node from the Vue `<FormKit>` component. There are three primary methods of fetching an input’s node.

- Using `getNode()` (or the Vue plugin’s `$formkit.get()` for Options API)
- Using `useFormKitNodeById`
- Using the `@node` event.
- Using a template `ref`.

#### Using `getNode()`

When using FormKit you can access a node by assigning it an `id` and then accessing it by that property via the `getNode()` function.

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
---
You must assign the input an `id` to use this method.
::

::Example
---
  name: "Get core node"
  file: "_content/_examples/node-get/node-get.vue"
---
::

::Callout
---
type: "info"
label: "Options API"
---
When using Vue’s Options API You can access the same `getNode()` behavior by using `this.$formkit.get()`.
::

#### Using `useFormKitNodeById()`

The `useFormKitNodeById` composition function allows you to access a node by its `id` from within a Vue component by returning a Vue `ref` that will be populated with the `FormKitNode` instance as soon as it has been created.

For other similar composition functions see the [composables](/inputs/form#composables) documentation.

::Callout
---
type: "warning"
---
You must assign the input an `id` to use this method.
::

::Example
---
  name: "Get core node"
  file: "_content/_examples/use-formkit-node-by-id/MyForm.vue"
---
::

#### Using the node event

Another way to get the underlying `node` is to listen to the `@node` event which is emitted only once when the component first initializes the node.

::Example
---
  name: "Node event"
  file: "_content/_examples/node-event/node-event.vue"
---
::

#### Using a template ref

Assigning a `<FormKit>` component to a `ref` also allows easy access to the node.

::Example
---
  name: "Node ref"
  file: "_content/_examples/node-ref/node-ref.vue"
---
::

## Traversal

To traverse nodes within a group or list use `node.at(address)` — where `address` is the `name` of the node being accessed (or the relative path to the name). For example:

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const group = createNode({
  type: 'group',
  children: [createNode({ name: 'email' }), createNode({ name: 'password' })],
})

// Returns the email node
group.at('email')
```

If the starting node has siblings, it will attempt to locate a match in the siblings (internally, this is what FormKit uses for validation rules like `confirm:address`).

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const email = createNode({ name: 'email' })
const password = createNode({ name: 'password' })
const group = createNode({
  type: 'group',
  children: [email, password],
})

// Accesses sibling to return the password node
email.at('password')
```

### Deep traversal

You can go deeper than one level by using a dot-syntax relative path. Here's a more complex example:

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const group = createNode({
  type: 'group',
  children: [
    createNode({ name: 'team' }),
    createNode({
      type: 'list',
      name: 'users',
      children: [
        createNode({
          type: 'group',
          children: [
            createNode({ name: 'email' }),
            createNode({ name: 'password', value: 'foo' }),
          ],
        }),
        createNode({
          type: 'group',
          children: [
            createNode({ name: 'email' }),
            createNode({ name: 'password', value: 'fbar' }),
          ],
        }),
      ],
    }),
  ],
})

// outputs: 'foo'
console.log(group.at('users.0.password').value)
```

Notice how traversing the `list` uses numeric keys, this is because the `list` type uses array indexes automatically.

<figure>

  :TreeTraversal

  <figcaption>Traversal path of <code>group.at('users.0.password')</code> shown in red.</figcaption>
</figure>

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Array paths"
---
Node addresses may also be expressed as arrays. For example `node.at('foo.bar')` could be expressed as `node.at(['foo', 'bar'])`.
::

### Traversal tokens

Also available for use in `node.at()` are a few special "tokens":

<div class="reference-table">

| Token     | Description                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$parent` | The immediate ancestor of the current node.                                                                                         |
| `$root`   | The root node of the tree (the first node with no parent).                                                                          |
| `$self`   | The current node in the traversal.                                                                                                  |
| `find()`  | A function that performs a breadth-first search for a matching value and property. For example: `node.at('$root.find(555, value)')` |

</div>

These tokens are used in dot-syntax addresses just like you would use a node’s name:

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const secondEmail = createNode({ name: 'email' })

createNode({
  type: 'group',
  children: [
    createNode({ name: 'team', value: 'charlie@factory.com' }),
    createNode({
      type: 'list',
      name: 'users',
      children: [
        createNode({
          type: 'group',
          children: [
            createNode({ name: 'email', value: 'james@peach.com' }),
            createNode({ name: 'password', value: 'foo' }),
          ],
        }),
        createNode({
          type: 'group',
          children: [
            secondEmail, // We're going to start here.
            createNode({ name: 'password', value: 'fbar' }),
          ],
        }),
      ],
    }),
  ],
})

// Navigate from the second email to the first
console.log(secondEmail.at('$parent.$parent.0.email').value)
// outputs: charlie@factory.com
```

<figure>
  
  :TreeTraversal2
  
  <figcaption>Traversal path of <code>secondEmail.at('$parent.$parent.0.email')</code> shown in red.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Events

Nodes have their own events which are emitted during the node’s lifecycle (unrelated to Vue’s events).

### Add listener

To observe a given event, use `node.on()`.

```ts twoslash
// Listen for any prop being set or changed.
node.on('prop', ({ payload }) => {
  console.log(`prop ${payload.prop} was set to ${payload.value}`)
})

node.props.foo = 'bar'
// outputs: prop foo was set to bar
```

Event handler callbacks all receive a single argument of type `FormKitEvent`, the object shape is:

```ts twoslash
{
  // The contents of the event — a string, an object, etc.
  payload: { cause: 'ice cream', duration: 200 },
  // The name of the event, this matches the first argument of node.on().
  name: 'brain-freeze',
  // Whether or not this event should bubble to the next parent.
  bubble: true,
  // The original FormKitNode that emitted the event.
  origin: node,
}
```

Node events (by default) bubble up the node tree, but `node.on()` will only respond to events emitted by the same node. However, if you would like to also catch events bubbling up from descendants you may append the string `.deep` to the end of your event name:

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const group = createNode({ type: 'group' })

group.on('created.deep', ({ payload: child }) => {
  console.log('child node created:', child.name)
})

const child = createNode({ parent: group, name: 'party-town-usa' })
// outputs: 'child node created: party-town-usa'
```

### Remove listener

Every call to register an observer with `node.on()` returns a “receipt” — a randomly generated key — that can be used later to stop observing that event (similar to [`setTimeout()` and `clearTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearTimeout)) using `node.off(receipt)`.

```ts twoslash
const receipt = node.on('input', ({ payload }) => {
  console.log('received input: ', payload)
})
node.input('foobar')
// outputs: 'received input: foobar'
node.off(receipt)
node.input('fizz buzz')
// no output
```

### Core events

The following is a comprehensive list of all events emitted by `@formkit/core`. Third-party code may emit additional events not included here.

<div class="reference-table">

| Name                      | Payload                         | Bubbles | Description                                                                                                            |

| `commit`                  | `any`                             | yes     | Emitted when a node's value is committed but before it has been transmitted to the rest of the form.                   |
| `config:{property}`       | `any` (the value)                 | yes     | Emitted any time a specific configuration option is set or changed.                                                    |
| `count:{property}`        | `any` (the value)                 | no      | Emitted any time a a ledger’s counter value changes.                                                                   |
| `child`                   | `FormKitNode`                   | yes     | Emitted when a new child node is added, created or assigned to a parent.                                               |
| `childRemoved`            | `FormKitNode`                   | yes     | Emitted when a new child node is removed from a parent.                                               |
| `created`                 | `FormKitNode`                   | yes     | Emitted immediately _before_ the node is returned when calling `createNode()` (plugins and features have already run). |
| `defined`                 | `FormKitTypeDefinition`         | yes     | Emitted when the node’s "type" is defined, this typically happens during `createNode()`.                               |
| `destroying`              | `FormKitNode`                   | yes     | Emitted when the `node.destroy()` is called, after it has been detached from any parents.                              |
| `dom-input-event`         | `Event`                         | yes     | Emitted when the `DOMInput` handler is called, useful for getting the original HTML input event in core.               |
| `input`                   | `any` (the value)                 | yes     | Emitted when `node.input()` is called — after the `input` hook has run.                                                |
| `message-added`           | `FormKitMessage`                | yes     | Emitted when a new `node.store` message was added.                                                                     |

When a configuration option changes, any inheriting nodes (including the origin node) will also emit <code>prop</code> and <code>prop:{propName}</code> events, so long as they do not override that property in their own <code>props</code> or <code>config</code> objects.
::

### Emitting events

Node events are emitted with `node.emit()`. You can leverage this feature to emit your own synthetic events from your own plugins.

```ts twoslash
node.emit('myEvent', payloadGoesHere)
```

An optional third argument `bubble` is also available. When set to `false`, it prevents your event from bubbling up through the form tree.

## Hooks

Hooks are middleware dispatchers that are triggered during pre-defined lifecycle operations. These hooks allow external code to extend the internal functionality of `@formkit/core`. The following table details all available hooks:

### Hook middleware

To make use of these hooks, you must register hook middleware. A middleware is a function that accepts 2 arguments — the value of the hook and `next` — a function that calls the next middleware in the stack and returns the value.

To register a middleware, pass it to the `node.hook` you want to use:

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const node = createNode()

// This would transform all labels to "Different label!"
node.hook.prop((payload, next) => {
  if ((payload.prop = 'label')) {
    payload.value = 'Different label!'
  }
  return next(payload)
})
```

::Callout

type: "tip"
label: "Use with plugins"

Hooks can be registered anywhere in your application, but the most common place hooks are used is in a plugin.
::

## Plugins

Plugins are the primary mechanism for extending the functionality of FormKit. The concept is simple — a plugin is just a function that accepts a node. These functions are then automatically called when a node is created, or when the plugin is added to the node. Plugins work similar to configuration options — they are automatically inherited by children and descendants.

```ts twoslash
import { createNode } from '@formkit/core'

// A plugin to change a prop value.
const myPlugin = (node) => {
  if (node.type === 'group') {
    node.props.color = 'yellow'
  } else {
    node.props.color = 'teal'
  }
}

const node = createNode([
  plugins: [myPlugin],
  children: [createNode()]
])
```

In the example above, the plugin is only defined on the parent, but the child also inherits the plugin. The function `myPlugin` will be called twice — once for each node in the graph (which only has two in this example):

<figure>
  
  :TreePlugin

  <figcaption>The plugin is inherited by the child, but executed independently.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Library

In addition to extending and modifying nodes, plugins serve one additional role — exposing input libraries. A “library” is a function assigned to the `library` property of a plugin that accepts a node and determines whether it knows how to “define” that node. If it does, it calls `node.define()` with an [input definition](/essentials/custom-inputs#input-definition).

For example, if we wanted to create a plugin that exposed a couple new inputs: `italy` and `france` we could write a plugin to do this:

::Example
---
  name: "Plugin library"
  file: "_content/_examples/plugin-library/plugin-library.vue"
  layout: "auto"
---
::

Experienced developers will notice a few exciting properties of this plugin-library pattern:

1. Multiple input libraries can be installed on the same project.
2. Plugins (and libraries) can be exposed locally, per form, group, or globally.
3. A plugin can bundle new inputs along with plugin logic making installation simple for end users.
4. The library function has full control over what conditions result in a call to `node.define()`. Frequently, this is simple check of `node.props.type` but you can define different inputs based on other conditions, like if a particular prop is set.

## Message store

Each node has its own data store. The objects in these stores are called "messages" and these messages are especially valuable for three primary use cases:

- Displaying information about the node to a user with i18n support (the validation plugin uses it).
- "Blocking" form submission.
- General data store for plugin authors.

Each message (`FormKitMessage` in TypeScript) in the store is an object with the following shape:

```ts twoslash
{
  // Whether or not this message blocks form submission (default: false).
  blocking: true,
  // Must be a unique string value (default: random string).
  key: 'yourkey',
  // (optional) Meta data object about this message (default: {}).
  meta: {
    // (optional) If set, i18n uses this instead of the key to find locale messages.
    messageKey: 'i18nKey',
    // (optional) If set, these arguments will be spread to the i18n locale function.
    i18nArgs: [...any],
    // (optional) If set to false, the message will check for localization.
    localize: true,
    // (optional) The message locale (default: node.config.locale)
    locale: 'en',
    // Any other meta data your heart desires.
    ...any
  },
  // An arbitrary category this message belongs to (for filtering purposes).
  // For example: 'validation' or 'success' (default: 'state')
  type: string,
  // (optional) should be a string, number, or boolean (default: undefined).
  value: 'Woops, our server is broken!',
  // Should this message be shown to end users? (default: true)
  visible: true
}
```

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Create message helper"
---
A helper function <code>createMessage({})</code> can be imported from <code>@formkit/core</code> to merge your message data with the above default values to create a new message object.
::

### Read and write messages

To add or update a message, use `node.store.set(FormKitMessage)`. Messages are then made available on `node.store.{messageKey}`

```ts twoslash
import { createMessage, createNode } from '@formkit/core'

const node = createNode()
const message = createMessage({
  key: 'clickHole',
  value: 'Please click 100 times.',
})

node.store.set(message)

console.log(node.store.clickHole.value)
// outputs: 'Please click 100 times.'
```

::Callout
---
type: "info"
label: "Message locales"
---
Messages will automatically be translated if the <code>@formkit/i18n</code> plugin is installed and a matching key is available in the active locale. <a href="/essentials/internationalization">Read the i18n docs</a>.
::

## Ledger

One of the keys to FormKit’s performance is its ability to efficiently count messages matching a given criteria (in the [store](#message-store)), and then keep a running tally of those messages as changes are made (including from child nodes). These counters are created using `node.ledger`.

### Creating a counter

Let's say we want to count how many messages are currently being displayed. We could do this by counting messages with the `visible` property set to `true`.

::Example
---
  name: "Count visible"
  file: "_content/_examples/count-visible/count-visible.vue"
---
::

Notice the second argument of `node.ledger.count()` is a function. This function accepts a message as an argument and expects the return value to be a boolean, indicating whether that message should be counted or not. This allows you to craft arbitrary counters for any message type.

When using a counter on a `group` or `list` node, the counter will propagate down the tree summing the value of all messages passing the criteria function and then tracking that count for store changes.

::Callout
---
type: "tip"
label: "Validation counter"
---
The validation plugin already declares a counter called <code>blocking</code> which counts the blocking property of all messages. This is how FormKit forms know if all their children are "valid".
::
