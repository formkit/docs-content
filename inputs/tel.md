The `tel` input uses HTML's [native tel input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel) and allows a user to enter a telephone number. Telephone numbers can also be entered with standard text inputs but some browsers (especially mobile ones) may improve the experience of entering telephone numbers by showing a different keypad.
