## 1.0.0-beta.10

### July 29, 2022

#### 🎉 New features

- Input definitions now have an optional `family` property, which adds a `data-family` attribute, and sets the value on `node.props.family`. This is useful for applying plugins and styles to entire "families" of inputs like the text family of inputs, which would apply to `text`, `email`, `password`, `number`, etc.

- Adds `data-multiple` attribute to checkboxes and radios when they have multiple options.
- Adds new `@submit-invalid` event to `type="form"` inputs. The event is triggered when a user attempts to submit a form but it has invalid inputs.

- Fixed a bug that caused a race condition between the @change event of a select list and the v-model value propagation ([#335](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/335)).
- Fixed a bug that caused conditional props/attrs that returned arrays to return objects instead of arrays ([#317](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/317)).
- Fixed a bug that caused empty file inputs to be set to undefined instead of an empty array when `node.reset()` is called ([#319](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/319)).
- Fixed a bug that caused the disabled prop to improperly disable checkboxes and radio inputs when set to a falsy (not nullish) value ([#307](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/307)).

- All inputs have been refactored to use a much improved schema composition API that allows easy composition and modification of schema based inputs.
- Adds new `meta` property to schema specification ([#248](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/248)).

## 1.0.0-beta.7

### May 9, 2022

#### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- The `update:model-value` event will now only be emitted when using the `v-model` directive.
- The `input` event is now debounced to reduce the amount of noise being emitted. You can use the new `input-raw` to listen to every input event.
- Errors set via `setErrors` are now automatically cleared on input by default. To revert to the previous behavior, set `preserveErrors: true` in your global config object.
- The `@formkit/tailwindcss` package is now deprecated — both the `formKitTailwind` plugin and the `generateClasses` function have been moved to the `@formkit/themes` package.

#### 🎉 New features

- `checkbox`, `radio`, and `select` inputs (inputs that use `:options`) can now use any data type as their value like numbers, objects, or even `null` ([#85](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/85)).
- Adds new `node.clearErrors` and `clearErrors` utilities to assist in clearing backend errors from an input or form.
- Now inputs automatically clear any errors set with `node.setErrors()` on user input. You can override this default behavior (to keep the error on the input) with `preserve-errors="true"`.

- Adds new `message` hook for modifying messages as they are being set.
- Adds a new core event `reset` — emitted after a form is reset.
- Adds a new `index` prop that allows inputs to be injected at a given index on a parent `list` type.
- The `<FormKit>` component’s `input` event is now debounced, meaning it emits much less noise.
- Exports all input feature functions `import { features } from '@formkit/inputs'`.
- Adds a new `input-raw` event to the `<FormKit>` component which is emitted for every single input event in an input, list, group, or form (very noisy).
- The core node is now the second argument of the `input`, `input-raw`, `submit` and `submit-raw` events.
- Adds new core node event `dom-input-event` which has the native HTML `Event` object as the payload.
- `@formkit/themes` now includes named exports for plugin functions for Tailwind CSS (`formKitTailwind`), Windi CSS (`formKitWindi`), and Uno CSS (`formKitUno`). By adding the correct plugin to your CSS framework's configuration file you will have access to a variety of formkit variants such as `formkit-invalid:` and `formkit-disabled:`.
- `@formkit/themes` now includes the [`generateClasses`](/essentials/styling#using-generateclasses-from-formkitthemes) helper function will allows you to easily supply different class lists to `${sectionKey}`s based on input type.
- Adds 🇸🇪 Swedish language.
- Adds 🇸🇮 Slovenian language.

## 1.0.0-beta.5

### March 8, 2022

#### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- The `data-loading` attribute has been moved from the submit button of a form
  to the `<form>` tag itself.

#### 🎉 New features

- Adds new `@formkit/tailwindcss` plugin to easily create Tailwind themes for your FormKit forms. Check out the [Create a Tailwind CSS theme](/guides/create-a-tailwind-theme) guide for more details.
- Adds a [new programmatic `reset` function](/inputs/form#resetting). This can be done on any input, group, form, or list and it will restore the value back to its initial state. It also resets the `context.state` object (like `blurred` and `dirty`).
- Improves accessibility by adding `aria-describedby` and `aria-live` to all provided input types. `aria-describedby` now targets help text, validation messages, and error messages (labeling provided by `<label>` tags that use the `for` attribute).
- Groups, lists and forms can now apply `undefined` values to their children. In other words, if a form is v-modeled and its value is set to an empty object `{}`, it will clear the entire form out.
- Adds new `context.state.settled` property that signals when the input’s internal debounce cycle has ended and a value is finished being committed to the form.
- Adds `data-submitted` attribute to inputs that have been submitted.
- Adds new section key `fileName` (thanks @santi).
- Adds new `parent` prop that accepts a [core node](/essentials/architecture#node) for advanced use cases where inputs are decoupled from their form or data structure is desired.
- Adds 🇱🇾 Arabic (thanks @Ahmedelforjani)
- Adds 🇩🇰 Danish (thanks @bjerggaard)
- Adds 🇮🇩 Indonesian (thanks @rama-adi)
- Adds 🇮🇹 Italian (thanks @punga78, @Archetipo95)
- Adds 🇵🇱 Polish (thanks @xxSkyy)
- Adds 🇰🇷 Korean (thanks @bwp618)
- Adds 🇻🇳 Vietnamese (thanks @oanhnn)
- Improved 🇫🇷 French (thanks @pop123123123)

#### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixes a bug that could cause validation errors to flash for 20ms before resolving when using browser autocomplete ([#99](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/99)).
- Fixes a bug that caused class props (like `input-class`) inside schemas to not properly respect the `$reset` command because it was treated like a variable ([#61](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/61)).
- Fixes a bug that didn't allow classes to be modified via section-key class props when the section-key has multiple words, such as `file-list-class` or `file-item-class` ([#120](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/120)).

- Adds `data-errors` attribute to the `outer` section when the input has explicitly placed errors (via prop or `setErrors`).
- Adds `data-complete` attribute to the `outer` section when an input ([playground example](https://formkit.link/59a772a70e06fdb7c19794f90b8c2b06)):
  - Either:
    - The input has validation rules.
    - The validation rules are all passing.
    - There are no errors on the input.
  - Or:
    - The input has no validation rules.
    - The input has no errors.
    - The input is dirty and has a value.
- New `context.state` properties:
  - `state.rules` - true when the input has validation rules.
  - `state.errors` - true when the input has explicit errors placed on it.
  - `state.complete` - same as logic as `data-complete`.

- Fixes a bug that prevented `file` inputs from triggering custom `onChange` events ([#90](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/90)).
- Fixes a bug that prevented forms from outputting their `id` to the DOM.
- Fixes a styling issue in the Genesis theme that caused select list items to be grey before an option was selected when using a placeholder ([#59](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/59))
- Fixes a bug that caused the `:value` prop on forms to be mutated on input ([#72](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/72)).
