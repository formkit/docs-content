# Inertia Plugin

:PageToc

The `@formkit/inertia` plugin aims to seamlessly integrate Inertia.js with FormKit forms, leveraging a robust event system that harnesses Inertia.js event callbacks and FormKit plugins for a smooth and powerful web development experience.

## Installation

To use the Inertia plugin we need to have a Laravel project already with Inertia Vue.JS installed and running you can check how by looking into the first sections of the guide [Using FormKit with Laravel Inertia](/guides/using-formkit-with-laravel-inertia).

Now you can install using your preferred package manager by following this bash command:

```bash
npm install @formkit/inertia
```

## Usage

To use the Inertia plugin we need to import the `useForm` function from `@formkit/inertia`, call the `useForm` function to receive the `form`, it comes with Inertia's method calls, reactive states, the addons for extensions, and the FormKit plugin.

The `useForm` function takes one optional argument for the initial fields that will be passed to your form via plugin, it will also return methods like `submit`, `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch` and `delete`. All of these methods will return a suitable function for use as FormKit’s `@submit` handler.

The easiest way to use it is by creating a new `const` with the resulting method of your choice, and adding the `form.plugin` to the FormKit form `:plugins`:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { useForm } from '@formkit/inertia'

  const form = useForm()
  const submitHandler = form.post('/login')
</script>

<template>
  <FormKit type="form" @submit="submitHandler" :plugins="[form.plugin]">
    <FormKit type="text" name="username" label="Username" />
    <FormKit type="password" name="password" label="Password" />
  </FormKit>
</template>
```

You could also also define the handler directly in your template:

```html
<FormKit
  type="form"
  @submit="(fields, node) => form.post('/login')(fields, node)"
  :plugins="[form.plugin]"
>
  <!-- The rest of your form -->
</FormKit>
```

The functions support all [visit options](https://inertiajs.com/manual-visits) from Inertia, such as `preserveState`, `preserveScroll`, and event callbacks.

::Callout
---
type: "info"
label: "Overwriting"
---
The <code>options</code> event callbacks will overwrite any default events to that specific event, meaning that if you for example add <code>onStart</code> you will lose the events from <code>start</code> that are for example loading, disabling and processing.
::

```html
<FormKit
  type="form"
  @submit="(fields, node) => form.post('/login', {
    preserveScroll: true,
    onSuccess: () => form.node.reset(),
  })(fields, node)"
  :plugins="[form.plugin]"
>
  <!-- The rest of your form -->
</FormKit>
```

To cancel a form submission, use the `cancel()` method.

```html
<FormKit
  type="form"
  @submit="(fields, node) => form.post('/login')(fields, node)"
  :plugins="[form.plugin]"
>
  <!-- The rest of your form -->
</FormKit>

<FormKit type="button" @click="form.cancel()" label="Cancel" />
```

The `useForm()` composable also returns reactive states. The Inertia ones are: `processing`, `progress`, `recentlySuccessful` and `wasSuccessful`, the FormKit based ones are `valid`, `errors`, `dirty` and `node`. For example, you could use the `processing` state to disable the form submit button while Inertia is processing the form (assuming that you’re using your own submit button):

```html
<template>
  <FormKit type="form" @submit="submit" :plugins="[form.plugin]">
    <FormKit type="text" name="username" label="Username" />
    <FormKit type="password" name="password" label="Password" />

    <template #submit>
      <FormKit type="submit" label="Log in" :disabled="form.processing" />
    </template>
  </FormKit>
</template>
```

## Addons

The main feature for extending functionality is by passing addons to `addon()`, this way you can target multiple events that will be triggered when those are called by Inertia's event callback system, `addon()` accepts a function or an array of functions with `on()`, it accepts any of the events from Inertia’s event callbacks (without the `on` prefix), specifically: `before`, `start`, `progress`, `success`, `error`, `cancel`, `cancelToken` and `finish`. The arguments passed to your callback are the Inertia event’s callback arguments and then FormKit's node:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { useForm } from '@formkit/inertia'

  const form = useForm()
  form.addon((on) => {
    on('before', (visit, node) => {
      return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this user?')
    })

    on('success', (page, node) => {
      toast('User deleted.')
    })
  })
</script>
```

If you need a single event callback `useForm()` also returns `on()` directly:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { useForm } from '@formkit/inertia'

  const form = useForm()
  form.on('before', (visit, node) => {
    return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this user?')
  })
</script>
```
