# FormKit Terms of Service

#### Last updated: April 8, 2024

Welcome! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of FormKit (“FormKit”, “Services”, or “Software”), a set of related websites and downloadable software including formkit.com, pro.formkit.com, and FormKit Pro, owned and operated by FormKit, Inc. (“FormKit”, “us, “we”, or “our”), a Delaware Corporation.

YOU INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS BY CLICKING, CHECKING, OR TAPPING A CHECKBOX TO THAT EFFECT, BY COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, OR BY USING ANY OF OUR SERVICES.

## Permitted Use

You may use FormKit provided that:

1. You have a valid [Project Key](#project-keys) installed on your project, regardless of license type.
2. You are the legal age of majority under applicable law to form a binding contract with us.
3. You are not barred from receiving such services under the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions.
4. And have provided current and factual identification, contact, and other information as part of the registration process.

If you do not meet all of the preceding requirements, you must not access or use FormKit.

## Project Keys

A Project Key (“License Key” or “License”) grants you the right to use any of the paid or closed-source Services (“Paid Services”) on unlimited development sites. Each Project Key is associated with a single project.

In addition to a Project Key, a payment method is also required when Paid Services are used in production.

## Restrictions

Except as otherwise expressly authorized in these Terms, you will not, and will ensure your employees, contractors, and other persons associated with your account (“Authorized Users”) do not, and will not encourage or assist third parties to:

1. Use the Software in excess of the licensed number of projects or domains.
2. Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, underlying structure, ideas, know-how, or algorithms of our Paid Services.
3. Distribute private npm tokens to anyone outside your organization. This restriction does not apply to "Pro Unlimited License" holders, who are authorized to share private npm tokens with their clients privately.
4. Publish The Software of our Paid Services to a publicly accessible repository.
5. Copy or distribute The Software, except as it relates to your licensed projects.
6. Provide, sell, resell, transfer, sublicense, lend, rent, or otherwise allow others to access or use our Paid Services, except as an integrated, non-primary component in Customer’s products or services. Direct resale or distribution of The Software in its original, standalone form is prohibited. Additionally, Customer's integration of The Software into their products must not enable third parties to use The Software independently.
7. Modify, create derivative works of, or remove proprietary notices from the Services.
8. Use the Software in violation of any United States or international law or regulation.
9. Access or use the Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees owed to FormKit.

## Charges and Payment

**Pricing.** Services are offered under multiple pricing plans, the specifications of which are available at [formkit.com/pro](https://formkit.com/pro) or on individual feature and product pages. Your rights and obligations depend partly on the pricing plan or features you use. We reserve the right to update prices at any time.

**Payment Terms and Recurring Charges.** When you purchase Services or use Services in production, you expressly authorize us or our third-party payment processor to charge you for such Services on a recurring monthly or annual basis and to be automatically charged using your Payment Methods. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment methods that you provide to us. We reserve the right to deactivate, terminate, prevent access to, disable services for, and delete any accounts or access to Services at any time at our sole discretion, including for nonpayment, late payment, or failure to charge your Payment Methods upon invoicing.

FormKit is not responsible for any additional bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by FormKit. Currency exchange settlements will be based on agreements between you and your credit card provider.

**Refunds.** FormKit is not obligated to issue refunds of any kind or amount.

## Termination

FormKit reserves the right to terminate or suspend your account for any breach of the Terms. In instances of minor breaches, we will notify you and offer a 30-day period for rectification. For serious breaches or violations that necessitate immediate action to protect our service or other users, FormKit may terminate or suspend your account without prior notice. In such cases, we will provide notification of the termination as soon as reasonably possible thereafter.

If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so only if you are not actively using our Services in production. If you need help closing your account, contact us at [support@formkit.com](mailto:support@formkit.com).
